# Fork- $\TeX$â€‹nique

A (new) $\LaTeX$ speed-typesetting game. Test yourself in single-player mode, or in multi-player mode in a customizeable lobby with friends. See [credits](#credits)!

Note that this project is currently a WIP, as it's recently been rewritten into React.

## Credits

This project was created to extend (the now relatively-unmaintained) [TeXnique](https://github.com/akshayravikumar/TeXnique) project, re-writing it from scratch in React/TypeScript to make it maintainable, adding additional features and a competitions platform -- hence the name. Credits & huge props to the original creators for making it!
